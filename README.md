# Monad and Monadic Approach in Functional Programming

**Monad** and **monadic approach** are important concepts in the world of functional programming. Monads are abstract structures that allow values and operations to be combined in a regular and secure way.

Monads have the following characteristics:

- There is an `of` or `unit` function to wrap a value.
- The `map` function takes the value of the current monad and creates a new monad by transforming this value with a function.
- The `chain` or `flatMap` function takes the value of the current monad and applies a function that returns another monad.

These features allow monads to manage values and operations in a sequential and secure way.

The monads that I share under this topic are:

## Maybe Monad
Used to handle error cases in a secure way. It has two subclasses: `Just`, which represents the result of a successful operation, and `Nothing`, which is used when the operation fails.

## Either Monad
Used to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful results. It has two subclasses: `Left`, which represents the erroneous result, and `Right`, which represents the successful result.

## Try Monad
Used to manage error cases. It has two subclasses: `Success`, which represents a successful operation, and `Failure`, which represents a failed operation.

Monads and monadic approaches make programming structures more understandable and manageable, while also allowing errors and operations to be handled safely and flexibly.
